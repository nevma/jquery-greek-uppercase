# JQuery greek uppercase plugin 

Replaces greek accented lowercase vowels with their non-accented uppercase equivalents.

A common problem for greek web designers who want to use the CSS `text-transform: uppercase;` on words that contain vowels with accute accents (ie "ά"), diaeresis (ie "ϊ") and acute diaeresis (ie "ΐ") is that these vowels do not look good when they are transformed to their uppercase equivalents.

```text
ά => Ά
ϊ => Ϊ
ΐ => ΅Ι
...
```

This script takes an HTML element, which is meant to be used with a `text-transform: uppercase;` and carefully replaes its accented lowercase vowels with their non-accented uppercase equivalents.

```text
ά => Α
ϊ => Ι
ΐ => Ι
...
```
