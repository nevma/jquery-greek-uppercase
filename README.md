# JQuery greek uppercase plugin 

Replaces greek accented lowercase vowels with their non-accented uppercase equivalents.

A common problem for greek web designers who want to use the CSS `text-transform: uppercase;` on words that contain vowels with accute accents (ie "ά"), diaeresis (ie "ϊ") and acute diaeresis (ie "ΐ") is that these vowels do not look good when they are transformed to their uppercase equivalents.

```text
ά => Ά
ϊ => Ϊ
ΐ => ΅Ι (OK, not actually a letter after all)
...
```

This script takes an HTML element, which is meant to be used with a `text-transform: uppercase;` and carefully replaces its accented lowercase vowels with their non-accented uppercase equivalents.

```text
ά => Α
ϊ => Ι
ΐ => Ι
...
```

It works carefully on the HTML elements it receives, so that it separates the possible HTML elements that they may contain from the actual text it is supposed to transform.

## Usage

You can call the plugin like this:

```javascript
$(function () {

    $( '.selector' ).greekUppercase();
    
});
```
